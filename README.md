Beekepers (are Users)  and they have an "Apiary".

"Apiaries" do not have names, but have an owner, and "own" "Hives".

"Hives" have names, and contain a set of "worker images".
"Hives" can have any number of "helpers" - other Beekeepers assigned to help with this hive. They all have roles (owner, manager) ? TBD.
